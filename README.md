# Java Budget Tracker

## About This Project
This is a simple desktop application built in Java to track income and expenses.  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my Java programming skills while building a basic functional and user-friendly tool for managing finances.

With this application, users can:
- Add transactions as income or expenses.
- Categorize transactions.
- View total income, total expenses, and remaining balance.
- Edit or delete existing transactions.
- See a real-time updated summary.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** Java, Swing, 


This project follows a simple MVC-style:
- **Transaction Class** – Stores individual transaction data (type, category, amount, description).
- **ExpenseTracker Class** – Holds a list of transactions and provides methods for adding, editing, deleting, and calculating totals.
- **MainWindow Class** – Builds the graphical user interface using Swing components such as `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JLabel`, `JButton`, and `JScrollPane`.

The app is event-driven and updates each time itmes are added or removed
